# T003 Orchestration Log

**Task**: User views dashboard with all processed notes and their summaries
**Started**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: In Progress

## User Story
As a knowledge worker, I can navigate to a dashboard to see all my uploaded files with their processing status, summaries, and download options in one place

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Grid layout displays all uploaded files with metadata (name, size, date, status, confidence)
2. Click card to expand and show full summary
3. Filter by status (All/Completed/Failed/Review Required)
4. Sort by Date/Name/Confidence
5. Empty state when no files exist
6. Loading skeletons while fetching

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend (backend-engineer)
**Files**:
- `app/api/documents/route.ts` (create)
- `__tests__/contract/documents.test.ts` (create)

**Deliverables**:
- GET /api/documents endpoint
- Joins uploaded_files + processed_documents + processing_logs
- Pagination support (optional for P0)
- Filtering by status (query param: ?status=completed)
- Sorting by field (query param: ?sort=confidence&order=asc)
- Returns array of documents with metadata

**API Contract**:
```typescript
GET /api/documents?status=completed&sort=date&order=desc

Response 200:
{
  "success": true,
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "meeting-notes.pdf",
      "size": 2097152,
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "uploadedAt": "2025-10-07T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "completed",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "processingDuration": 6700,
      "summary": {
        "topics": ["Q4 Strategy", "Budget Planning"],
        "decisions": ["Hire 3 engineers by EOY"],
        "actions": ["Schedule design review"],
        "lno_tasks": {
          "leverage": ["Define metrics for Q4"],
          "neutral": ["Update documentation"],
          "overhead": ["File expense reports"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Frontend (frontend-ui-builder)
**Files**:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (create)
- `app/components/__tests__/dashboard-page.test.tsx` (create)

**Deliverables**:
- Dashboard page route at /dashboard
- Grid layout with file cards (using ShadCN Card component)
- Filter UI (ShadCN Select or Tabs)
- Sort UI (ShadCN Select)
- Expand/collapse card functionality
- Empty state UI
- Loading skeletons (ShadCN Skeleton)
- Dark/light mode support
- Mobile responsive

**ShadCN Components Needed**:
- Card (card header, content, footer)
- Badge (for status and confidence)
- Skeleton (loading state)
- Tabs or Select (for filtering)
- Button (for actions)
- Alert (for empty state)

### Phase 3: Quality Pipeline
1. **code-reviewer**: Review all code changes
2. **test-runner**: Validate test suite
3. **debugger**: (if tests fail) Root cause analysis

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Phase 0: Context gathering
- [ ] Phase 1: Backend implementation
- [ ] Phase 2: Frontend implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Code review
- [ ] Phase 4: Test validation
- [ ] Phase 5: Complete

## Notes
- T001 (Upload) and T002 (Summary Display) are prerequisites and marked complete
- Database schema already exists - no migrations needed
- Focus on vertical slice: Backend → Frontend → User can demo full feature
