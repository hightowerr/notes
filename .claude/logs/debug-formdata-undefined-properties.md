# Debug Report: FormData File Properties Undefined in Tests

## Error Summary

**Location:** Test suite - upload contract tests, upload flow integration tests
**Symptom:** FormData file properties (`file.name`, `file.size`, `file.type`) are `undefined` when accessed in API route handlers during tests
**Affected Tests:** 14 tests failing (12 contract tests + 2 integration tests)

**Example Error:**
```javascript
[UPLOAD] File validation failed: {
  filename: undefined,
  size: undefined,
  type: undefined,
  error: 'Unsupported file format: undefined. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD',
  code: 'UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT',
  timestamp: '2025-10-08T20:19:43.855Z'
}
```

## Initial Hypotheses

### 1. **Undici File Implementation Incomplete [HIGH CONFIDENCE - 95%]**
**Evidence:**
- `__tests__/setup.ts` line 28-29 uses `undici` package for FormData/File polyfills:
  ```typescript
  globalThis.FormData = FormData as any;
  globalThis.File = File as any;
  ```
- Tests create File objects: `new File(['content'], 'test.pdf', { type: 'application/pdf' })`
- Upload route accesses properties: `file.name`, `file.size`, `file.type` (upload/route.ts lines 52-54)
- `undici`'s File implementation may not fully support all File API properties in Node.js environment

**Supporting Evidence:**
- `package.json` line 53: `"undici": "^6.22.0"` is present
- Vitest config uses `jsdom` environment (vitest.config.ts line 13), not browser
- Node.js native File API was only added in Node.js 18, may have incomplete implementation
- FormData in Next.js API routes expects Web Standard File, but `undici` may provide minimal implementation

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- `undici` is the official Node.js fetch implementation, should be compatible
- Used successfully in many Next.js test suites

**Likelihood:** 95% - This is the most probable root cause

---

### 2. **FormData Blob/File Coercion Issue [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - 60%]**
**Evidence:**
- `upload/route.ts` line 29 extracts file: `const file = formData.get('file') as File | null;`
- FormData.get() returns `FormDataEntryValue` which could be string or File
- In test environment, may be returning a Blob-like object without File properties
- Type assertion `as File` doesn't guarantee runtime properties exist

**Supporting Evidence:**
- FormData spec allows strings OR Files
- Test environment may serialize File to Blob, losing metadata
- Properties like `name`, `size`, `type` are File-specific, not on base Blob

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- Tests explicitly create File objects with constructor
- FormData.append() should preserve File type
- Would see TypeScript errors if type mismatch was obvious

**Likelihood:** 60% - Possible, but less likely than undici implementation gap

---

### 3. **Async ArrayBuffer Extraction Breaking File Reference [LOW CONFIDENCE - 30%]**
**Evidence:**
- `upload/route.ts` line 67: `const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();`
- After converting to ArrayBuffer, original File object may be consumed/invalidated
- Some File implementations are single-read streams

**Supporting Evidence:**
- File objects in Node.js may be stream-based
- Reading arrayBuffer() could consume the underlying data source
- Would explain why properties become undefined AFTER arrayBuffer call

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- Code accesses file.name and file.size BEFORE arrayBuffer call (lines 52-54)
- Error logs show properties are undefined during validation, which happens before arrayBuffer
- File spec requires properties to be non-enumerable metadata, always accessible

**Likelihood:** 30% - Timeline doesn't match (properties undefined before consumption)

---

### 4. **Missing File Constructor Arguments in undici [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - 70%]**
**Evidence:**
- Tests create File: `new File(['content'], 'test.pdf', { type: 'application/pdf' })`
- File constructor in undici may not properly store second/third arguments (filename, options)
- Implementation gap where File is created but metadata isn't attached

**Supporting Evidence:**
- `undici` File class might be a minimal implementation for fetch compatibility
- May only store blob data, ignore filename and options
- Common issue with polyfills - implement minimum required for fetch, not full File API

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- undici v6.22.0 is recent, should have complete File implementation
- File API is standard, unlikely to have major gaps in official Node.js library

**Likelihood:** 70% - Very plausible, undici File may be minimal implementation

---

### 5. **jsdom Environment Limitations [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - 50%]**
**Evidence:**
- vitest.config.ts line 13: `environment: 'jsdom'`
- jsdom provides browser-like globals, but not perfect browser compatibility
- File API may not be fully implemented in jsdom's polyfills
- Conflicts between jsdom's File and undici's File possible

**Supporting Evidence:**
- jsdom is DOM-only, doesn't implement all Web APIs
- File API is relatively new, may not be in jsdom's scope
- setup.ts manually assigns globalThis.File = undici's File, might override incomplete jsdom File

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- setup.ts explicitly uses undici's File, not jsdom's
- jsdom environment is standard for React component tests
- Would affect many projects if jsdom File was broken

**Likelihood:** 50% - Possible interaction issue, but explicit undici assignment should prevent

---

### 6. **Type Casting Hiding Runtime Mismatch [LOW CONFIDENCE - 20%]**
**Evidence:**
- Multiple type assertions in tests and route:
  - `formData.get('file') as File | null` (upload/route.ts line 29)
  - `globalThis.File = File as any` (setup.ts line 29)
- TypeScript may pass, but runtime object doesn't have expected properties

**Supporting Evidence:**
- `as any` bypasses type checking
- Could be getting Blob or Buffer-like object, not true File
- Properties would be undefined if object shape doesn't match

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- Console logs would show object type if fundamentally wrong
- Would see "Cannot read property 'name' of null" not "name is undefined"
- Type assertions are necessary for test environment setup

**Likelihood:** 20% - Type system issue unlikely to cause property values to be undefined

---

## Top Candidates

### **1. Undici File Implementation Incomplete [CONFIDENCE: 95%]**

**Root Cause:** `undici`'s File class in Node.js environment doesn't properly store or expose `name`, `size`, and `type` properties when File objects are created with the standard constructor.

**Why this is most probable:**
1. **Direct Evidence:** Tests use `new File([content], filename, { type })` from undici
2. **Property Access Pattern:** File properties are accessed immediately after FormData extraction, before any async operations
3. **Known Issue:** Node.js File API is relatively new, polyfill implementations often incomplete
4. **Consistent Failure:** ALL tests using File constructor fail the same way - suggests systematic issue with File creation, not usage

**Detailed Analysis:**

**How undici File SHOULD work (Web Standard):**
```typescript
const file = new File(['content'], 'test.pdf', { type: 'application/pdf' });
console.log(file.name);  // 'test.pdf'
console.log(file.size);  // 7 (length of 'content')
console.log(file.type);  // 'application/pdf'
```

**How undici File MIGHT be implemented (minimal):**
```typescript
// undici/lib/fetch/file.js (hypothetical incomplete implementation)
class File extends Blob {
  constructor(fileBits, fileName, options = {}) {
    super(fileBits, options);
    // BUG: fileName and options.type not stored as properties
    // Only blob data is stored, metadata is lost
  }
  // Missing: name, type getters
  // Size is inherited from Blob, but name/type are File-specific
}
```

**Evidence from Error Logs:**
```javascript
// Validation happens IMMEDIATELY after file extraction
// Before any async operations (arrayBuffer, hashing, etc.)
const file = formData.get('file') as File;
const validation = validateFileUpload(file);  // <-- FAILS HERE

// validateFileUpload checks:
if (file.size === 0) // size is undefined → fails
if (!ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES.includes(file.type)) // type is undefined → fails
const extension = file.name.substring(...) // name is undefined → crashes
```

**Why This Affects Tests But Not Production:**
- **Production:** Browser's native File API (complete implementation)
- **Tests:** Node.js environment with undici polyfill (potentially incomplete)
- **Browser File:** Has native properties stored by browser engine
- **undici File:** Manually implemented, may miss edge cases

---

### **2. Missing File Constructor Arguments in undici [CONFIDENCE: 70%]**

**Root Cause:** undici's File constructor receives arguments but doesn't properly assign them to instance properties.

**Why this is plausible:**
- Very similar to Hypothesis 1, but more specific to constructor implementation
- File object is created successfully (no constructor errors)
- But properties are not accessible after creation
- Suggests constructor runs but doesn't store metadata

**Key Difference from #1:**
- #1: File class missing property getters entirely
- #2: File class has getters, but constructor doesn't set internal values

**Both point to same fix, just different implementation details**

---

## Validation Logs Added

### Step 1: Verify undici File Implementation

**File:** `__tests__/setup.ts` (add after line 29)

```typescript
// Validate undici File implementation
const testFile = new File(['test content'], 'debug-test.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
console.log('[DEBUG SETUP] undici File test:');
console.log('  - File instance:', testFile);
console.log('  - file.name:', testFile.name);
console.log('  - file.size:', testFile.size);
console.log('  - file.type:', testFile.type);
console.log('  - file.constructor.name:', testFile.constructor.name);
console.log('  - Has name property:', 'name' in testFile);
console.log('  - Has size property:', 'size' in testFile);
console.log('  - Has type property:', 'type' in testFile);
```

**Expected Output if BROKEN:**
```
[DEBUG SETUP] undici File test:
  - File instance: File { [Symbol(state)]: { data: [...], type: '' } }
  - file.name: undefined        ❌
  - file.size: 12              ✓
  - file.type: undefined        ❌
  - file.constructor.name: File
  - Has name property: false    ❌
  - Has size property: true     ✓
  - Has type property: false    ❌
```

**Expected Output if WORKING:**
```
[DEBUG SETUP] undici File test:
  - File instance: File { ... }
  - file.name: 'debug-test.txt' ✓
  - file.size: 12               ✓
  - file.type: 'text/plain'     ✓
  - Has name property: true     ✓
  - Has size property: true     ✓
  - Has type property: true     ✓
```

### Step 2: Check FormData Preservation

**File:** `__tests__/contract/upload.test.ts` (add before line 36 in first test)

```typescript
// Debug: Verify File properties before and after FormData
const file = new File(['content'], 'test.pdf', { type: 'application/pdf' });
console.log('[DEBUG TEST] Before FormData.append:');
console.log('  - file.name:', file.name);
console.log('  - file.size:', file.size);
console.log('  - file.type:', file.type);

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', file);

const retrievedFile = formData.get('file');
console.log('[DEBUG TEST] After FormData.get:');
console.log('  - retrievedFile:', retrievedFile);
console.log('  - retrievedFile.name:', (retrievedFile as any)?.name);
console.log('  - retrievedFile.size:', (retrievedFile as any)?.size);
console.log('  - retrievedFile.type:', (retrievedFile as any)?.type);
console.log('  - Are same instance?', retrievedFile === file);
```

### Step 3: Verify in API Route

**File:** `app/api/upload/route.ts` (add at line 30, right after file extraction)

```typescript
const file = formData.get('file') as File | null;

// DEBUG: Log file object state
console.log('[DEBUG ROUTE] File extracted from FormData:');
console.log('  - file:', file);
console.log('  - file?.constructor?.name:', file?.constructor?.name);
console.log('  - file?.name:', file?.name);
console.log('  - file?.size:', file?.size);
console.log('  - file?.type:', file?.type);
console.log('  - typeof file:', typeof file);
console.log('  - file instanceof File:', file instanceof File);
console.log('  - Object.keys(file):', file ? Object.keys(file) : 'null');
console.log('  - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(file):', file ? Object.getOwnPropertyNames(file) : 'null');
```

## Observed Behavior

**Status:** PENDING - Need to run tests with added logging to confirm hypothesis

**Expected Observations:**

**If Hypothesis 1/2 is correct (undici File incomplete):**
```
[DEBUG SETUP] undici File test:
  - file.name: undefined  ❌ CONFIRMS ROOT CAUSE
  - file.type: undefined  ❌ CONFIRMS ROOT CAUSE

[DEBUG TEST] Before FormData.append:
  - file.name: undefined  ❌ BROKEN AT CREATION

[DEBUG ROUTE] File extracted from FormData:
  - file?.name: undefined ❌ PERSISTS THROUGH FORMDATA
```

**If Hypothesis 3/5 is correct (jsdom or async issue):**
```
[DEBUG SETUP] undici File test:
  - file.name: 'debug-test.txt' ✓ File creation works

[DEBUG TEST] Before FormData.append:
  - file.name: 'test.pdf'       ✓ Works before FormData

[DEBUG ROUTE] File extracted from FormData:
  - file?.name: undefined       ❌ Lost during FormData/route transition
```

## Root Cause

**CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (pending validation):**

undici's File implementation in Node.js v18/20 does not properly implement the `name` and `type` properties required by the Web File API standard. When File objects are created with `new File(bits, name, options)`, the filename and type are not stored as accessible properties on the instance.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Web Standard File API:**
   - `File` interface extends `Blob`
   - MUST have `name` (string), `lastModified` (number) properties
   - Inherits `size` and `type` from Blob
   - Reference: https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#file-section

2. **undici Implementation Gap:**
   - File class exists for fetch compatibility
   - Stores blob data correctly (size works)
   - Missing property definitions for `name` and `type`
   - These properties return undefined instead of constructor values

3. **Why Production Works:**
   - Browsers have native File API implementation
   - Browser File objects created by `<input type="file">` have all properties
   - FormData in browser context uses native File

4. **Why Tests Fail:**
   - Tests create File programmatically with `new File()`
   - Node.js environment uses undici polyfill
   - Polyfill is incomplete for programmatic File creation
   - FormData correctly passes File object, but properties are already undefined

## User Impact

**User Journey Affected:**
- ✅ **Production:** Users upload files via browser - WORKS (native File API)
- ❌ **Testing:** Automated tests cannot validate upload functionality
- ❌ **CI/CD:** Deployment pipeline blocked by failing tests
- ❌ **Development:** Developers cannot run tests locally to verify changes

**Specific Breakage:**
```
Developer Action: npm run test
Expected: All upload tests pass
Actual: 14/14 upload tests fail with "undefined file properties"
Impact: Cannot verify upload functionality works
```

**NOT A PRODUCTION BUG** - This is a **test environment issue only**. Real users with browsers are unaffected.

## Corrective Plan

### **Solution 1: Use Node.js Native File (Node.js 20+) [RECOMMENDED]**

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 20.x or later (has native File API)
- Remove undici File polyfill

**File:** `__tests__/setup.ts`
**Lines:** 4, 28-29

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
import { FormData, File } from 'undici';
// ...
globalThis.FormData = FormData as any;
globalThis.File = File as any;

// AFTER
import { FormData } from 'undici';
// Remove File import - use Node.js native File (available in Node 20+)
globalThis.FormData = FormData as any;
// DON'T override globalThis.File - use Node.js built-in
// Node.js 20+ has native File API: https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#class-file
```

**Verification:**
```typescript
// Add to setup.ts to verify native File works
if (!globalThis.File) {
  throw new Error('Native File API not available. Upgrade to Node.js 20+');
}

const testFile = new File(['test'], 'test.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
if (!testFile.name || !testFile.type) {
  throw new Error('Node.js File API incomplete. Check Node.js version.');
}
```

**Why this fixes the root cause:**
- Node.js 20+ includes native File API in global scope
- Native implementation fully compliant with Web standards
- No polyfill gaps or compatibility issues
- FormData from undici can work with native File

**Side Effects:**
- Requires Node.js 20+ (check with `node --version`)
- May need to update CI/CD pipeline Node version
- Need to verify .nvmrc or package.json engines field

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verify Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v20.0.0 or higher

# Run tests
npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

---

### **Solution 2: Create Custom File Polyfill [ALTERNATIVE]**

**If Node.js version cannot be upgraded**

**File:** `__tests__/setup.ts`
**Lines:** Add after line 31

**Change:**
```typescript
// Custom File implementation with proper property storage
class TestFile extends Blob {
  private _name: string;
  private _lastModified: number;

  constructor(bits: BlobPart[], name: string, options?: FilePropertyBag) {
    super(bits, { type: options?.type });
    this._name = name;
    this._lastModified = options?.lastModified ?? Date.now();
  }

  get name(): string {
    return this._name;
  }

  get lastModified(): number {
    return this._lastModified;
  }

  get webkitRelativePath(): string {
    return '';
  }

  // Inherit size and type from Blob
}

// Override globalThis.File with our complete implementation
globalThis.File = TestFile as any;

// Verify implementation
const verifyFile = new File(['test'], 'verify.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
if (!verifyFile.name || verifyFile.name !== 'verify.txt') {
  throw new Error('File polyfill failed: name property not working');
}
if (!verifyFile.type || verifyFile.type !== 'text/plain') {
  throw new Error('File polyfill failed: type property not working');
}
console.log('[SETUP] Custom File polyfill verified ✓');
```

**Why this fixes the root cause:**
- Provides complete File implementation with all required properties
- Properties stored as private fields, exposed via getters
- Extends Blob for proper inheritance of size/type
- Fully compatible with FormData and fetch

**Side Effects:**
- Adds ~30 lines of polyfill code to test setup
- Need to maintain custom implementation if Web API changes
- May miss edge cases not covered by polyfill

**Testing:**
```bash
npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts --reporter=verbose
```

---

### **Solution 3: Mock File in Tests [WORKAROUND]**

**Quick fix without changing File implementation**

**File:** `__tests__/contract/upload.test.ts`
**Pattern:** Wrap File creation in helper function

**Change:**
```typescript
// Add helper at top of test file
function createTestFile(content: string, filename: string, mimeType: string): File {
  const file = new File([content], filename, { type: mimeType });

  // Manually attach properties if missing (polyfill workaround)
  if (!file.name) {
    Object.defineProperty(file, 'name', {
      value: filename,
      writable: false,
      enumerable: true,
    });
  }

  if (!file.type) {
    Object.defineProperty(file, 'type', {
      value: mimeType,
      writable: false,
      enumerable: true,
    });
  }

  return file;
}

// USE IN TESTS
it('should accept valid PDF file', async () => {
  const file = createTestFile('PDF content', 'test.pdf', 'application/pdf');
  // ... rest of test
});
```

**Why this fixes the root cause:**
- Manually adds missing properties to File instances
- Works with existing undici File implementation
- Minimal changes to test files

**Side Effects:**
- Need to use helper for every File creation
- Doesn't fix root cause, just works around it
- Properties are added AFTER construction, not ideal
- More brittle than proper File implementation

**Testing:**
```bash
npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts
```

---

### **Solution 4: Use Buffer + Manual File-like Object [LEGACY]**

**Last resort if all else fails**

**File:** Tests
**Pattern:** Create plain object with File-like interface

**Change:**
```typescript
// Create File-like object without File constructor
function createMockFile(content: string, filename: string, mimeType: string) {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(content);

  return {
    name: filename,
    size: buffer.length,
    type: mimeType,
    lastModified: Date.now(),
    arrayBuffer: async () => buffer.buffer,
    stream: () => {
      const { Readable } = require('stream');
      return Readable.from(buffer);
    },
    text: async () => content,
    slice: (start?: number, end?: number, contentType?: string) => {
      return new Blob([buffer.slice(start, end)], { type: contentType || mimeType });
    },
  };
}
```

**Why this might work:**
- Completely bypasses File constructor
- Manually implements all required properties and methods
- Full control over object shape

**Side Effects:**
- Not a real File instance
- May fail instanceof checks
- Fragile - easy to miss required methods
- Not recommended unless other solutions fail

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Solution 1: Use Node.js 20+ Native File** [RECOMMENDED - 30 min]
   - Check Node.js version
   - Remove undici File import if Node 20+
   - Add version verification to setup.ts
   - Run full test suite

2. **Solution 2: Custom File Polyfill** [FALLBACK - 1 hour]
   - If Node.js version < 20
   - Implement complete File class in setup.ts
   - Verify all properties work
   - Run full test suite

3. **Solution 3: Mock File Helper** [WORKAROUND - 2 hours]
   - If Solutions 1-2 don't work
   - Create helper in test files
   - Update all File creations
   - Document workaround

4. **Solution 4: Buffer Mock** [LAST RESORT - 4 hours]
   - Only if instanceof File checks can be removed
   - Requires route changes to accept File-like objects
   - Not recommended

---

## Related Areas to Test After Fix

1. **All Upload Contract Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts
   ```
   - File size validation
   - MIME type validation
   - File extension validation
   - Duplicate detection (content hash)

2. **Upload Integration Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- __tests__/integration/upload-flow.test.ts
   ```
   - End-to-end upload journey
   - Database insertion
   - Storage upload
   - Processing log creation

3. **Process Tests (depend on upload):**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- __tests__/contract/process.test.ts
   ```
   - May currently be blocked by upload failures
   - Should pass once File properties work

4. **Summary Display Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- __tests__/integration/summary-display.test.tsx
   ```
   - May have timing issues (separate from File issue)
   - Address after upload tests pass

## Files to Modify

**Primary Files:**
1. `/home/yunix/learning-agentic/ideas/Note-synth/notes/__tests__/setup.ts` - File polyfill fix
2. `/home/yunix/learning-agentic/ideas/Note-synth/notes/.nvmrc` - Verify Node.js version

**Verification Files:**
3. `/home/yunix/learning-agentic/ideas/Note-synth/notes/package.json` - Check engines field
4. `/home/yunix/learning-agentic/ideas/Note-synth/notes/__tests__/contract/upload.test.ts` - Test validation

**No Changes Needed:**
- `app/api/upload/route.ts` - Code is correct, environment is the issue
- `lib/schemas.ts` - Validation logic is correct

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check Node.js version
node --version  # Need v20.0.0+

# 2. Check if native File API exists
node -e "console.log(typeof File)"  # Should print "function" in Node 20+

# 3. Test File properties directly
node -e "const f = new File(['test'], 'test.txt', {type: 'text/plain'}); console.log(f.name, f.size, f.type)"
# Should print: test.txt 4 text/plain

# 4. Run failing tests with verbose output
npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts --reporter=verbose

# 5. Run all tests to verify full fix
npm run test
```

---

## Additional Investigation Needed

**If Solution 1 fails (Node 20+ but File still broken):**

1. Check if File is actually available:
   ```javascript
   console.log('File in global:', 'File' in globalThis);
   console.log('File constructor:', globalThis.File);
   ```

2. Check if jsdom overrides it:
   ```javascript
   console.log('File in jsdom:', typeof window?.File);
   ```

3. Check undici version compatibility:
   ```bash
   npm list undici
   # Current: undici@6.22.0
   # Try upgrading: npm install undici@latest
   ```

**If Solution 2 fails (Custom polyfill doesn't work):**

1. Verify Blob implementation:
   ```javascript
   const blob = new Blob(['test'], { type: 'text/plain' });
   console.log('Blob type:', blob.type);
   console.log('Blob size:', blob.size);
   ```

2. Check if properties are readonly:
   ```javascript
   const file = new File(['test'], 'test.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
   console.log('Property descriptors:', Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(file));
   ```

3. Test FormData interaction:
   ```javascript
   const formData = new FormData();
   formData.append('file', testFile);
   const retrieved = formData.get('file');
   console.log('Retrieved type:', retrieved?.constructor?.name);
   ```

## Conclusion

**Root Cause (95% confidence):**
undici's File implementation does not properly store `name` and `type` properties when File objects are created programmatically with `new File()` in Node.js test environment.

**Primary Fix:**
Upgrade to Node.js 20+ and use native File API instead of undici polyfill.

**Fallback Fix:**
Implement custom File class in test setup with proper property storage.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Upload contract tests: 12/12 passing (up from 0/12)
- Upload integration tests: 2/2 passing (up from 0/2)
- Unblocks process and summary tests (currently cascading failures)
- Total impact: ~15-20 tests fixed

**Validation Method:**
1. Apply Solution 1 (Node 20 native File)
2. Run: `npm run test -- __tests__/contract/upload.test.ts`
3. Expected: All tests pass, no undefined property errors
4. If fails, fallback to Solution 2 (custom polyfill)
