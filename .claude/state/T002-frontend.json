Toast notifications via sonner. SummaryPanel displays topics, decisions, actions, and LNO tasks with proper animations and accessibility.",
  "user_journey": "User uploads file → sees 'Processing' badge with spinner → backend processes file → status polling detects completion → 'Complete' badge appears → toast notification shows 'Summary ready for {filename}' → SummaryPanel slides in with all extracted data (topics, decisions, actions, LNO tasks) → user can scroll through all sections",
  "user_action_enabled": "User can now see AI-generated summaries automatically appear after file upload without manual intervention. User can view topics as badges, decisions with checkmarks, actions with priority indicators, and LNO tasks organized in three columns. Low confidence summaries show 'Review Required' badge.",
