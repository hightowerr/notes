## Console Logs Reference

### Successful Processing Flow
```
[UPLOAD SUCCESS] { fileId: 'abc-123', filename: 'test.pdf', status: 'processing' }
[PROCESSING START] { fileId: 'abc-123', filename: 'test.pdf' }
[CONVERSION] { fileId: 'abc-123', format: 'pdf', markdownLength: 1234 }
[AI SUMMARIZATION] { fileId: 'abc-123', provider: 'openai', model: 'gpt-4o' }
[PROCESSING COMPLETE] { fileId: 'abc-123', duration_ms: 4523, confidence: 87 }
```

### Failed Processing
```
[UPLOAD SUCCESS] { fileId: 'abc-123', filename: 'test.pdf', status: 'processing' }
[PROCESSING START] { fileId: 'abc-123', filename: 'test.pdf' }
[ERROR] { fileId: 'abc-123', error: 'Invalid API key', code: 'SUMMARIZATION_ERROR' }
[PROCESSING FAILED] { fileId: 'abc-123', duration_ms: 2341, error: '...' }
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Summary Not Appearing
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid
3. Check `/api/status/<fileId>` response manually
4. Verify database `processed_documents` has entry
5. Confirm polling is active (Network tab)

### Processing Takes >8 Seconds
1. Check file size (large PDFs may take longer)
2. Verify OpenAI API response time (external dependency)
3. Check console for retry logs
4. Review `processing_logs.duration_ms` in database

### Invalid JSON from AI
1. Check console for retry attempts
2. Verify Zod schema matches AI output
3. Review `processing_logs.error_details`
4. Test with simpler file content

### Storage Errors
1. Verify Supabase bucket permissions
2. Check storage quota limits
3. Confirm MIME type is allowed
4. Review Supabase Dashboard logs
