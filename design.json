    "description": "High-level visual and interaction design guidelines for the AI Note Synthesiser, expressed as a design-system spec. This file is written from a creative director’s perspective so it can guide future UI work, not just mirror current implementation.",
    "designIntent": [
      "Feel like a focused, premium productivity cockpit rather than a generic dashboard.",
      "Balance analytical clarity with a calm, low-noise visual tone.",
      "Make AI-powered decisions feel trustworthy and explainable, not magical and opaque.",
      "Be genuinely usable on small mobile screens, not just “responsive” on paper."
    ]
  },
  "designPrinciples": {
    "clarityOverCleverness": "Prioritise information hierarchy and legibility over decorative visuals. Every visual decision should make it easier to understand status, priorities, or next actions.",
    "depthNotDecor": "Use the depth layer system (bg-layer-1–4, two-layer shadows) to convey structure and importance, not as eye candy. Stronger elevation means more interactivity or current focus.",
    "calmByDefault": "Avoid visual noise. Keep borders subtle, rely on spacing, typography, and depth to separate sections. Use colour sparingly to call attention to decisions, errors, and key actions.",
    "trustworthyAI": "When AI acts, show status, progress, and results clearly. Use consistent badges, toasts, and panels so users can trace what happened and why.",
    "mobileFirstReality": "Design every surface to work comfortably at 320–414px. No horizontal scrolling, no cramped controls, and touch targets at least 44px high.",
    "oneSystemAcrossScreens": "Desktop, tablet, and mobile should feel like the same product: same tokens, same component behaviours, and consistent microinteractions.",
    "motionWithPurpose": "Use motion (Framer Motion, CSS transitions) to confirm state changes (uploads, status changes, AI results) and reduce cognitive load. Avoid gratuitous animation loops."
