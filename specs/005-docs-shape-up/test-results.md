# [Queue] Processing batch 1/1 (20 tasks)
# [Queue] Batch 1 complete (3.5s)

# Verify no rate limit errors

## Performance Validation

### Current Scale Testing

**Automated**: Tests run with small datasets (<100 embeddings)
**10K Scale**: ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL LOAD TEST

**Manual Load Test Procedure**:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate 50 test documents (200 tasks each = 10,000 total)
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
    -F "file=@test-documents/sample-200-tasks-${i}.pdf"
done

# Step 2: Wait for processing (estimate: 15-20 minutes)
# Monitor progress:
watch -n 10 'psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM task_embeddings WHERE status='\''completed'\'';"'

# Step 3: Verify 10,000 embeddings
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM task_embeddings WHERE status='completed';"
# Expected: 10000

# Step 4: Test search performance at scale
time curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/embeddings/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "optimize database performance", "limit": 20, "threshold": 0.7}'

# Expected: real time <0.5s (500ms) - FR-017

# Step 5: Check storage efficiency
psql -c "SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('task_embeddings')) as table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('task_embeddings')) as index_size,
  count(*) as embedding_count,
  pg_total_relation_size('task_embeddings') / count(*) as bytes_per_embedding
FROM task_embeddings;"

# Expected for 10K embeddings:
# - table_size: ~62 MB
# - index_size: ~6 MB
# - bytes_per_embedding: <10240 (10KB) - FR-023
```

**Expected Results**:
- Search time: <500ms (FR-017)
- Storage per embedding: <10KB (FR-023)
- Total storage: ~62MB for 10K embeddings

**Current Status**:

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Load Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Run 10K embedding load test before production
   - Verify search latency remains <500ms at scale
   - Confirm storage efficiency <10KB per embedding

2. **Monitoring** (CRITICAL):
   - Set up alerts for search latency >500ms
   - Monitor OpenAI API error rates
   - Track queue depth metrics
   - Alert on embeddings_status='pending' spike

3. **Database Maintenance**:
   - Schedule `ANALYZE task_embeddings` after bulk uploads
   - Monitor index performance (IVFFlat may need tuning)
   - Set up automated backups for vector data

### Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Integrate load testing into CI/CD pipeline
   - Automated regression detection for search latency

2. **Synthetic Load Testing**:
   - Staging environment with production-scale data
   - Automated nightly performance validation

3. **Scale Improvements** (beyond 100K embeddings):
   - Migrate from IVFFlat to HNSW index
   - Implement persistent queue (Redis/PostgreSQL)
   - Consider read replicas for search queries
