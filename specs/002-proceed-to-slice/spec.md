# Feature Specification: AI-Generated Summary Display After Automatic Processing

**Feature Branch**: `002-proceed-to-slice`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "proceed to slice T002 from @specs/001-prd-p0-thinnest/tasks.md Use slice-orchestrator and other agents to implement [T002] following SYSTEM_RULES mandate."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature identified: T002 - AI-generated summary display
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Knowledge worker (note uploader)
   → Actions: View AI-generated summary automatically after upload
   → Data: Summaries (topics, decisions, actions, LNO tasks)
   → Constraints: <8 seconds processing time, automatic display
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clear from existing T001 foundation and task spec
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User uploads file → system processes → summary appears
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable via UI interaction
6. Identify Key Entities
   → ProcessedDocument, Summary, ProcessingLog
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No implementation details, focuses on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, after uploading a note file (PDF/DOCX/TXT), I want to see an AI-generated summary appear automatically within 8 seconds without clicking anything, so that I can immediately understand the key topics, decisions, actions, and tasks from my notes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has uploaded a meeting notes PDF (5MB), **When** the file upload completes, **Then** the system automatically processes the file and displays a summary panel showing topics, decisions, actions, and LNO tasks within 8 seconds
2. **Given** a user has uploaded a document, **When** processing is in progress, **Then** the status badge displays "Processing" with an animated indicator
3. **Given** a user's document has been processed successfully, **When** the summary is ready, **Then** the status badge changes to "Complete" with a green checkmark and a toast notification appears
4. **Given** a user's document processing has failed, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the status badge shows "Failed" and an error message with retry option is displayed
5. **Given** a user receives a summary with low confidence (<80%), **When** the summary displays, **Then** a "review required" badge appears indicating manual verification is needed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI returns malformed JSON? (System retries with adjusted parameters)
- What happens when a PDF is unreadable? (System attempts OCR fallback, marks as "review required" if fails)
- What happens when processing takes longer than 8 seconds? (Status updates continue, warning indicator appears)
- What happens when the file contains no extractable text? (System logs error, displays "No content found" message)
- What happens when multiple files are uploaded simultaneously? (Each file shows independent processing status)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**File Processing**
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger processing immediately after file upload completes without user interaction
- **FR-002**: System MUST convert PDF, DOCX, and TXT files to Markdown format
- **FR-003**: System MUST attempt OCR processing for unreadable PDF files as a fallback
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a content hash for processed content to enable deduplication

**AI Summarization**
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract topics from uploaded documents
- **FR-006**: System MUST extract decisions from uploaded documents
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract action items from uploaded documents
- **FR-008**: System MUST extract LNO tasks (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead) from uploaded documents
- **FR-009**: System MUST retry summarization once with adjusted parameters if AI returns invalid JSON
- **FR-010**: System MUST calculate a confidence score for each summary

**Data Storage**
- **FR-011**: System MUST store the generated Markdown file
- **FR-012**: System MUST store the JSON summary with topics, decisions, actions, and LNO tasks
- **FR-013**: System MUST record processing metrics including duration, confidence score, and any errors
- **FR-014**: System MUST update file status to "completed" or "failed" after processing

**User Feedback**
- **FR-015**: System MUST display real-time processing status updates to the user
- **FR-016**: System MUST display the summary panel when processing completes successfully
- **FR-017**: System MUST show a toast notification when summary is ready
- **FR-018**: System MUST display error messages with retry options when processing fails
- **FR-019**: System MUST flag summaries with confidence score below 80% as "review required"
- **FR-020**: System MUST complete the entire upload → process → display cycle within 8 seconds under normal conditions

**Observability**
- **FR-021**: System MUST log file hash, processing duration, and confidence score to console
- **FR-022**: System MUST record processing events (start, complete, error) in processing logs
- **FR-023**: System MUST track retry attempts and their outcomes

### Key Entities

- **ProcessedDocument**: Represents a document that has been converted from its original format to Markdown, with associated metadata including original file reference, processing timestamp, and conversion status
- **Summary**: Contains the AI-extracted structured data from a document, including topics list, decisions list, actions list, and LNO tasks categorized into Leverage/Neutral/Overhead columns, along with confidence score
- **ProcessingLog**: Records processing events and metrics for each file, including start time, completion time, duration, errors encountered, retry counts, and final status
