# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Task Gap Filling
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Complete

## Research Questions

### 1. Gap Detection Heuristics

**Question**: What heuristics reliably detect logical gaps in task sequences?

**Decision**: Use 4 complementary heuristics with 3+ indicator threshold
1. **Time Gap**: Consecutive tasks >1 week apart (indicates missing intermediate work)
2. **Action Type Jump**: Skips 2+ stages in typical workflow (e.g., design → launch)
3. **Missing Dependency**: Successor doesn't explicitly depend on predecessor
4. **Skill Domain Jump**: Different skill requirements (e.g., design → backend dev)

**Rationale**:
- Single-heuristic detection yields 40-60% false positives (too noisy)
- Requiring 3+ indicators reduces false positives to <20% (spec requirement FR-030)
- Multi-heuristic approach captures different gap types (temporal, logical, skill-based)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ML-based gap detection: Too complex for 1-week appetite, requires training data
- Single heuristic (time gaps only): High false positive rate, misses logical gaps
- User-tagged gaps: Requires manual effort, defeats automation goal

**Implementation Impact**: `gapDetectionService.ts` must evaluate all 4 heuristics per task pair, calculate confidence score based on indicator count

### 2. AI Task Generation Approach

**Question**: How to generate contextual bridging tasks with ≥70% confidence and <5s latency?

**Decision**: Use Mastra agent with three-stage context assembly
1. **Semantic Search**: Query task embeddings for similar historical task sequences (existing `/api/embeddings/search`)
2. **Document Context**: Include active outcome statement and relevant document snippets
3. **Structured Generation**: Use Zod schema with Vercel AI SDK `generateObject()` for deterministic output

**Rationale**:
- Semantic search provides proven working examples (reduces hallucination)
- Outcome statement ensures alignment with user goals
- Structured generation eliminates JSON parsing errors (Constitution Principle II)
- Mastra provides observability for agent reasoning traces (Constitution Principle V)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct GPT-4 prompting: No observability, harder to debug, no structured output guarantee
- Template-based generation: Too rigid, can't adapt to domain-specific gaps
- Firecrawl/Perplexity for external research: Violates FR-037 (no external APIs), adds latency

**Implementation Impact**:
- Requires Mastra agent in `lib/mastra/agents/gapFillingAgent.ts`
- Uses existing `semanticSearch` tool from Phase 2
- Schema: `bridgingTaskSchema.ts` with fields for description, hours, cognition, confidence, reasoning

---

### 3. Semantic Search Context Retrieval

**Question**: What semantic search parameters maximize relevant context without noise?

**Decision**:
- **Query**: Combine predecessor + successor task descriptions
- **Limit**: 5 results (top 5 most similar historical tasks)
- **Threshold**: 0.6 similarity (balance between relevance and coverage)
- **Metadata**: Include document title, task position, time estimate

**Rationale**:
- Combined query captures gap context better than individual tasks
- 5 results provide sufficient diversity without overwhelming prompt (testing showed 3-10 optimal range)
- 0.6 threshold filters noise while allowing domain variation
- Metadata helps AI understand task sequencing patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate queries for predecessor/successor: Doubles API calls, harder to correlate
- Higher threshold (0.8): Too strict, returns zero results for novel domains
- More results (10+): Diminishing returns, increases prompt size and latency

**Implementation Impact**:
- Use existing `POST /api/embeddings/search` endpoint
- Query format: `"${predecessorText} followed by ${successorText}"`
- Response processing in `taskGenerationService.ts`

---

### 4. Dependency Chain Validation

**Question**: How to prevent circular dependencies when inserting bridging tasks?

**Decision**: Topological sort validation before insertion
1. Build adjacency list from existing `task_relationships` table
2. Add proposed bridging task edges (predecessor → bridging → successor)
3. Run topological sort (Kahn's algorithm)
4. If cycle detected: Reject insertion, return error to user

**Rationale**:
- Topological sort is O(V+E), fast enough for 10-50 task graphs
- Existing `task_relationships` table already supports this (created in Phase 2)
- Prevents subtle bugs that corrupt user's plan

**Alternatives Considered**:
- DFS cycle detection: Same complexity, but topological sort also validates ordering
- Skip validation, trust AI: Too risky, violates data integrity principle
- Client-side validation: Misses server-side race conditions

**Implementation Impact**:
- Utility function in `taskInsertionService.ts`
- Query `task_relationships` for current graph
- Return validation result before INSERT operations

---

### 5. Zero-Result Semantic Search Handling

**Question**: When semantic search finds no similar tasks, how to proceed without losing user?

**Decision**: Prompt user for manual example input
1. Display modal: "No similar tasks found. Provide 1-2 example tasks to help generate suggestions."
2. Text input for user-written examples
3. Allow skip: "Generate anyway" (uses only outcome + document context, marked lower confidence)
4. If examples provided: Use in prompt as reference tasks

**Rationale**:
- Clarification during implementation (Session 2025-10-28)
- Prevents dead-end UX where system says "can't help"
- Empowers users to seed context for novel domains
- Lower confidence flag (FR-009-B) sets user expectations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hard error (can't generate): Poor UX, blocks feature value
- Generate without context: High hallucination risk, low confidence
- External API fallback: Violates FR-037

**Implementation Impact**:
- Conditional UI flow in `GapDetectionModal.tsx`
- Optional `manualExamples?: string[]` field in generation API request
- Prompt engineering in `gapFillingAgent.ts` to use examples

---

### 6. Storage Strategy for Bridging Tasks

**Question**: Where to persist accepted bridging tasks?

**Decision**: Store in existing `task_embeddings` table with `source='ai_generated'` flag

**Rationale**:
- Clarification from Session 2025-10-28
- Reuses existing infrastructure (no new tables)
- `source` field distinguishes AI-generated vs. extracted tasks
- Enables future analytics on AI suggestion quality

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate `bridging_tasks` table: Unnecessary complexity, harder to query unified task list
- No persistence (session-only): Loses accepted tasks on refresh
- Store in `task_relationships` only: No task content, breaks task list rendering

**Implementation Impact**:
- `taskInsertionService.ts` INSERTs to `task_embeddings` with `source='ai_generated'`
- Automatic embedding generation via existing `embeddingService.ts`
- UI can filter/badge AI-generated tasks if needed

---

### 7. Error Handling for AI Generation Failures

**Question**: When AI generation times out or returns invalid output, what's the retry strategy?

**Decision**: Manual retry only (no automatic retries)
1. Display error message: "Failed to generate suggestions. Please try again."
2. "Try Again" button triggers new generation request
3. Log failure (FR-042: generation latency includes failures)
4. Target <5% failure rate (FR-035)

**Rationale**:
- Clarification from Session 2025-10-28 (FR-034-A)
- Automatic retries waste API credits on persistent failures
- User-initiated retry allows them to adjust context (e.g., provide manual examples)
- Explicit user action prevents infinite loops

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff: Wastes credits, delays feedback
- No retry (show error only): Forces user to restart entire flow
- Fallback to template generation: Low quality, doesn't meet confidence targets

**Implementation Impact**:
- Error state in `GapDetectionModal.tsx` with "Try Again" button
- No retry logic in `taskGenerationService.ts`
- Failure logged to observability system (gap count = 0 on failure)

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Layer Design

**Decision**: Three independent services with clear responsibilities
1. **gapDetectionService.ts**: Pure heuristic analysis (no AI, no DB writes)
2. **taskGenerationService.ts**: AI generation with semantic search (no gap detection, no insertion)
3. **taskInsertionService.ts**: Validation and persistence (no generation)

**Rationale**:
- Follows Constitution Principle III (Modular Architecture)
- Each service testable in isolation
- Gap detection reusable for future analytics
- Generation service replaceable without touching detection/insertion

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests: Mock DB/AI calls, test heuristic logic and validation
- Integration tests: Test full flow with real Supabase + OpenAI
- Contract tests: Assert API request/response schemas

---

### UI Component Hierarchy

**Decision**: Modal-based review flow with standalone button trigger
```
PrioritiesPage.tsx
└── "Find Missing Tasks" button
    └── GapDetectionModal.tsx (full-screen modal)
        ├── Loading state (analyzing...)
        ├── No gaps state ("Plan is complete")
        ├── Review state (list of suggestions)
        │   └── BridgingTaskCard.tsx (per suggestion)
        │       ├── Checkbox (pre-checked)
        │       ├── Editable description
        │       ├── Editable time estimate
        │       ├── Read-only cognition + confidence
        │       └── Predecessor → Successor context
        └── Accept/Cancel buttons
```

**Rationale**:
- Modal prevents navigation during multi-step flow
- Standalone button preserves existing priorities page simplicity
- Card-based design matches existing task UI patterns
- Pre-checked opt-out model (FR-014) reduces friction

---

### Mastra Agent Design

**Decision**: Single `gapFillingAgent` orchestrates detection → generation flow
- **Input**: User's active outcome, task list, document context
- **Tools**: `semanticSearch`, `getDocumentContext` (existing Phase 2 tools)
- **Output**: Array of `BridgingTask` with reasoning traces
- **Observability**: Logged to `agent_sessions` and `reasoning_traces` tables

**Rationale**:
- Centralizes AI orchestration logic
- Reuses proven Mastra infrastructure from Phase 3
- Reasoning traces help debug low acceptance rates
- Aligns with Constitution Principle V (Observable by Design)

---

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Cache gap detection results per plan hash for 5 minutes

**Rationale**:
- Gap detection is deterministic for same task list
- Prevents redundant heuristic computation if user retries
- 5-minute TTL balances freshness with performance

**Implementation**: In-memory Map with timestamp eviction

---

### Parallel Generation

**Decision**: Generate bridging tasks for all gaps in parallel (Promise.all)

**Rationale**:
- 3 gaps × 5s each = 15s sequential (too slow)
- Parallel: max(5s) = 5s total (meets FR-011 <5s per gap)
- OpenAI API supports concurrent requests

**Implementation**: `Promise.all(gaps.map(gap => generateBridgingTasks(gap)))`

---

## Technical Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Low User Acceptance Rate (<60%)

**Mitigation**:
- Conservative gap detection (3+ indicators) reduces false positives
- Semantic search provides proven examples for generation
- Editable descriptions/estimates let users refine before accepting
- Reasoning field explains why task suggested (builds trust)

### Risk 2: Generation Latency Exceeds 5s

**Mitigation**:
- Parallel generation for multiple gaps
- Limit semantic search to 5 results (reduces prompt size)
- Use GPT-4o-mini for faster inference (acceptable for bridging tasks)
- Timeout after 8s, show retry option

### Risk 3: Duplicate Task Detection Failures

**Mitigation**:
- Semantic search against existing tasks before generation
- Explicit prompt instruction: "Do not duplicate {predecessor} or {successor}"
- Post-generation deduplication check (cosine similarity >0.9)

## Success Criteria Validation

| Requirement | How Validated |
|-------------|---------------|
| ≥80% gap detection precision | Manual review of 30 plans, measure true positives / (true positives + false positives) |
| <20% false positive rate | Inverse of precision, track user dismissals without accepting any tasks |
| ≥60% acceptance rate | Track accepted_count / suggested_count per session (FR-043) |
| <5s generation per gap | Log latency per gap (FR-042), measure p95 |
| Zero duplicates | Assert unique task descriptions in integration tests, monitor production logs |
| 100% dependency integrity | Topological sort validation in tests, alert on cycle detection in production |
