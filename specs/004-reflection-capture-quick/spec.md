- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16
- Q: When a background recompute job fails (e.g., AI service timeout, invalid response), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Reflection saved, error toast shown (user notified but reflection persists)
- Q: When a user tries to submit a reflection but experiences offline/network error, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show immediate error, discard reflection (user must retype when online)
- Q: What logging/observability signals should be captured for operational monitoring? ‚Üí A: Basic only: reflection created, recompute triggered (minimal logging)
- Q: If two users add reflections simultaneously (rare edge case), how should the system handle concurrent reflection inserts? ‚Üí A: Both succeed independently (append-only, no conflict)
- Q: Who/what enforces the "indefinite retention" policy for reflections (FR-051)? ‚Üí A: Application responsibility (no automated deletion, manual cleanup only if needed)

## Problem Statement

Users currently experience static prioritization based solely on long-term outcome statements that change infrequently. However, daily life context shifts significantly: energy levels fluctuate, constraints emerge, blockers arise, and momentum shifts.

Without a way to communicate current state, the system continues surfacing the same high-intensity work even when users are burnt out, have limited time blocks, or are blocked on dependencies. This creates a mismatch between suggested priorities and actual capacity, leading to task avoidance and guilt.

**The core gap**: The system knows where users are going (outcome) but not where they are today (current state/context).

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to quickly capture my current life context (energy, constraints, blockers, momentum) in 10-60 seconds so that the system can adjust my task priorities to match my actual capacity and situation today, without requiring deep journaling or time-consuming reflection exercises.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm feeling burnt out on Monday morning, **When** I add a reflection "Feeling burnt out, need lighter tasks", **Then** the system immediately promotes quick-win tasks (15min, low focus) and demotes high-intensity strategic work (4h, deep focus)

2. **Given** I just had a successful client call on Wednesday, **When** I add "Client call went well, momentum high!", **Then** the system promotes strategic work that capitalizes on my energy and demotes mindless administrative tasks

3. **Given** I have back-to-back meetings today, **When** I add "Only have 30min blocks today", **Then** the system surfaces short-duration tasks that fit my time constraints and hides longer tasks

4. **Given** I've added 3 reflections over 7 days, **When** I view my priorities, **Then** today's reflection has 100% influence weight, 3-day-old reflection has ~70% weight, and 7-day-old reflection has 50% weight

5. **Given** I open the reflection input, **When** I type 35 characters of text, **Then** I see no character counter (anxiety-free experience)

6. **Given** I type 455 characters, **When** the count reaches 450, **Then** I see a gentle character counter appear

7. **Given** I type 500 characters, **When** I attempt to continue, **Then** I see message "Reflections work best when concise. Wrap up this thought." (discourage but don't hard-block)

8. **Given** I submit a reflection, **When** the submission completes, **Then** the textarea clears within 200ms, new reflection appears at top of recent list, toast shows "‚úÖ Reflection added", and priority recompute triggers in background within 2 seconds

9. **Given** I have 0 reflections, **When** I open the reflection panel, **Then** I see empty state with example and explanation (first-time guidance)

10. **Given** I add 3 reflections within 30 seconds, **When** the last one submits, **Then** system triggers only 1 recompute (debounced) and shows toast "‚úÖ 3 reflections added. Updating priorities..."

11. **Given** I'm on desktop (<1400px width), **When** I first visit the page, **Then** reflection panel is collapsed by default (discoverability via icon or keyboard)

12. **Given** I'm on mobile, **When** I open reflection input, **Then** I see full-screen modal (not sidebar)

13. **Given** I submit a reflection on mobile, **When** submission completes, **Then** modal auto-closes and I return to previous screen

14. **Given** I open reflection panel via keyboard shortcut (Cmd+R), **When** panel opens, **Then** textarea auto-focuses

15. **Given** I open reflection panel via mouse click, **When** panel opens, **Then** textarea does NOT auto-focus (user might be browsing, not typing)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user adds identical reflection text on consecutive days?
  - **Answer**: System accepts both (no deduplication). Duplicate text signals sustained state (e.g., burnout persisting), which is valid signal for prioritization.

- How does system handle reflections with no meaningful content?
  - **Answer**: Minimum 10 characters enforced to prevent accidental empty saves. If user submits exactly 10 chars of random text, system accepts (no content validation beyond length).

- What happens to reflections older than 30 days?
  - **Answer**: Reflections older than 30 days receive ~0.06 weight (effectively zero in scoring calculations), but remain stored in system for potential future analytics features.

- How does system prevent API overload if user rapidly adds many reflections?
  - **Answer**: Recompute requests are debounced by 2 seconds. Only the last reflection in a burst triggers recompute. Rate limit: maximum 1 recompute per user per 10 seconds.

- What happens if recompute job fails?
  - **Answer**: Reflection is saved successfully to database. User sees error toast notification (e.g., "Could not update priorities. Your reflection was saved."). Priorities remain unchanged until next successful recompute. No automatic retry.

- How are reflections handled during offline/network errors?
  - **Answer**: System shows immediate error toast (e.g., "No connection. Please try again when online."). Reflection text is NOT saved locally or persisted. User must retype reflection when network connection restored. Textarea remains populated until user closes panel (allows immediate retry if connection returns quickly).

- What happens if user adds reflections from multiple devices simultaneously?
  - **Answer**: Both reflections succeed independently (append-only model, no conflict). Each reflection gets unique ID and precise timestamp. System treats concurrent inserts as separate valid context captures. Recent list shows most recent 5 by timestamp across all devices.

- **NFR-015**: ‚â•15% of actions SHOULD change rank after reflection added (priority shift evidence)

### Key Entities

- **Reflection**: Represents a user's brief capture of current life context (energy, constraints, blockers, momentum). Contains unique ID, plain text (10-500 chars), and precise timestamp. Cannot be edited or deleted after creation. Append-only model allows concurrent inserts without conflict (multi-device safe). Used to influence task prioritization dynamically.

- **Recency Weight**: Calculated value representing influence strength of a reflection based on age. Uses exponential decay with 7-day half-life. Today's reflection = 1.0 weight, 7 days old = 0.5 weight, 30 days old = ~0.06 (effectively zero). Weights <0.10 are excluded from scoring.

- **User Outcome**: Existing entity representing long-term goal statement (e.g., "Increase MRR by 25%"). Reflections complement outcomes by adding short-term context without replacing long-term direction.

- **Task/Action Priority**: Calculated ranking of extracted tasks influenced by both outcome alignment (long-term) and reflection context (short-term). Reflections shift priorities up/down based on feasibility given current user state.

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Existing system**: Outcome management feature (T008-T011) must be functional to provide long-term context baseline
- **Existing system**: Task extraction and prioritization logic must exist to apply reflection-based adjustments
- **Existing system**: Recompute service (T012) must be operational to trigger priority recalculation

### Assumptions
- Users understand that reflections influence priorities but don't override outcome direction completely
- Users are willing to spend 10-60 seconds capturing context for improved prioritization
- Exponential decay with 7-day half-life accurately models how reflection relevance fades over time
- 5 most recent reflections provide sufficient context for priority adjustment (no need to process 10+ reflections)
- Desktop users will discover collapsed panel via icon or keyboard shortcut without onboarding
- Mobile users prefer full-screen modal over sidebar for text input
- Append-only model (no editing/deleting) reduces friction more than it frustrates users
- Character limits (10-500) strike balance between meaningful content and quick capture
- Indefinite reflection storage will not create significant storage cost burden (average 30-150 chars per reflection)
- Manual cleanup by operations team is acceptable approach if storage costs become concern in future
