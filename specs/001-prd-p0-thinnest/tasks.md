### ✅ T002 [SLICE] User sees AI-generated summary after automatic processing completes
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION-READY (2025-10-09)
**Production Verified**: OCR fallback ✅ | Confidence scoring ✅ | Anti-hallucination ✅ | Performance <8s ✅
**Test Coverage**: Manual testing complete (see T002_MANUAL_TEST.md) | 23/38 automated tests passing (15 blocked by FormData test environment limitations)
**User Story**: As a knowledge worker, after uploading a note file, I can see an AI-generated summary with topics, decisions, actions, and LNO tasks appear automatically within 8 seconds without clicking anything

**Production Verification Evidence** (2025-10-09):
- **Test File**: Module 2 - Article 2 - Leveraging Excel for Financial Insights.pdf (126KB)
- **Processing Time**: 4.3 seconds (well under 8s target)
- **OCR Fallback**: ✅ Correctly detected scanned PDF, applied placeholder
- **Confidence Scoring**: ✅ 30% confidence → triggered `review_required` status
- **Anti-Hallucination**: ✅ No fabricated tasks (e.g., "Implement OCR") - validates 2025-10-09 fix
- **AI Output**: 2 topics, 0 decisions, 2 actions, 2 LNO tasks (minimal content as expected for OCR placeholder)
- **Status Polling**: ✅ Real-time updates every 2s, stopped appropriately when complete
- **Database**: ✅ All tables updated correctly with 30-day expiry policy

**Implementation Scope**:

### T005 [SLICE] User sees system handle concurrent uploads correctly (max 3 parallel)
**User Story**: As a user who uploads multiple files at once, I can upload 5 files simultaneously and see the system process 3 immediately while queuing the remaining 2, with clear status for each file

**Implementation Scope**:
- **UI** (`app/page.tsx` - enhance for multiple uploads):
  - Multi-file upload support (drag multiple files)
  - Individual progress bars for each file
  - Status indicators: "Uploading" / "Processing" / "Queued" / "Complete"
  - Queue position display: "Queued (2/2)"

- **Backend**:
  - **Queue Service** (`lib/services/processingQueue.ts` - create):
    * Implement concurrency control (max 3 parallel)
    * Queue additional uploads beyond limit (FR-017)
    * Process queue in FIFO order
    * Track active processing jobs

  - **Upload Endpoint** (`app/api/upload/route.ts` - enhance):
    * Check current active jobs count
    * If <3: trigger immediate processing
    * If ≥3: add to queue, return queue position

- **Data**:
  - `uploaded_files` table: add `queue_position` field
  - In-memory or Redis queue for active job tracking

- **Feedback**:
  - Each file shows individual status
  - Queued files display: "Queued - Position 2 of 2"
  - Console logs concurrent processing metrics

**Test Scenario**:
1. Upload 5 files simultaneously (drag 5 PDFs together)
2. Verify 3 files show "Processing" immediately
3. Confirm 2 files show "Queued - Position 1 of 2" and "Position 2 of 2"
4. Wait for first file to complete
5. Verify queued file moves to "Processing" automatically
6. Check all 5 files eventually complete
7. Confirm console logs show concurrency management
8. Validate `uploaded_files` table reflects queue positions

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx` (multi-file upload UI)
- `lib/services/processingQueue.ts` (create)
- `app/api/upload/route.ts` (integrate queue service)
- Database migration: add `queue_position` to `uploaded_files`

---

## Phase 3: Data Management

### T006 [SETUP] Implement automatic cleanup of processed files after 30 days
**Why Needed**: FR-018 requires 30-day rolling retention to prevent storage bloat

**Implementation Scope**:
- **Scheduled Job** (`lib/jobs/cleanupExpiredFiles.ts` - create):
  - Cron job or serverless function (runs daily)
  - Query `note_summaries` where `expires_at < NOW()`
  - Delete from Supabase storage: original file + markdown
  - Delete from database: `note_summaries`, `uploaded_files` records
  - Log cleanup metrics

- **Backend** (`app/api/cleanup/route.ts` - create - optional manual trigger):
  - Manual cleanup endpoint for admin use
  - Same logic as scheduled job

- **Data**:
  - Set `expires_at = created_at + 30 days` when creating `note_summaries` record

**Validation**:
- Cron job configured (e.g., Vercel Cron, GitHub Actions)
- Test cleanup with expired mock data
- Verify files deleted from storage and database

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/jobs/cleanupExpiredFiles.ts` (create)
- `vercel.json` or `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml` (cron config)
- `app/api/cleanup/route.ts` (optional manual trigger)

  - "Export JSON" button → download summary as `.json`
  - "Export Markdown" button → download formatted `.md`
  - Bulk export from dashboard → zip multiple summaries

- **Backend** (`app/api/export/[fileId]/route.ts` - create):
  - GET endpoint to retrieve summary in requested format
  - Format Markdown with proper headings, lists
  - Set content-disposition headers for download

**Test Scenario**:
1. Process a file to generate summary
2. Click "Export JSON" → verify JSON downloads
3. Click "Export Markdown" → verify formatted MD downloads
4. From dashboard, select 3 files → export → verify ZIP contains all summaries

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/SummaryPanel.tsx` (add export buttons)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (add bulk export)
- `app/api/export/[fileId]/route.ts` (create)

---

**Enhancement to**: T002

**Implementation Scope**:
- **UI** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):
  - "Retry" button on failed file cards
  - Manual retry trigger

- **Backend** (`app/api/retry/[fileId]/route.ts` - create):
  - POST endpoint to requeue failed file
  - Reset status to "processing"
  - Increment retry_count in `processing_logs`
  - Use adjusted AI parameters (lower temperature, higher tokens)

**Test Scenario**:
1. Simulate processing failure (mock AI error)
2. Navigate to dashboard → find failed file
3. Click "Retry" button
4. Verify file re-enters processing queue
5. Confirm retry_count increments in logs

**Files Modified**:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (add retry button)
- `app/api/retry/[fileId]/route.ts` (create)
- `lib/services/aiSummarizer.ts` (support adjusted params on retry)
