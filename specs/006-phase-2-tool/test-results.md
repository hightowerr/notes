# Mastra Phase 2: Tooling Test Results

**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Tester**: Codex (automated validation)

## Summary

This report captures the validation work performed while executing Task T012. The
workspace does not include the seeded Supabase data set referenced in `quickstart.md`
(20 source documents, processed markdown, and embeddings). Because of that gap the
end-to-end quickstart scenarios could not be exercised against real data. Instead we
ran the automated integration checks that ship with the repository and documented all
remaining blockers so a future manual pass can be completed quickly once the data
fixtures are available.

## Overall Status: **BLOCKED**

> Full quickstart validation is blocked pending access to production-like Supabase
> data (uploaded files, processed markdown, embeddings, and task relationships). The
> automated integration suite confirms tool registration, telemetry logging, and
> performance-warning behaviour, but it does not substitute for the manual scenarios.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 5 tools execute without errors _(via `vitest run -- tool-execution.test.ts`)_
- [ ] All tool outputs match contract schemas _(needs contract test run or manual spot-check)_
- [ ] All tools complete within P95 < 5 s target _(blocked: requires load test + dataset)_
- [ ] Schema validation passes for all outputs _(blocked: manual spot-check not run)_
- [ ] Database migration 010 applied successfully _(not re-verified during this task)_
- [ ] Task relationships stored correctly in database _(blocked: no task data available)_
- [ ] Clustering produces semantically coherent groups _(blocked: no embeddings)_
- [ ] Dependency detection returns logical relationships _(blocked: no embeddings/context)_
- [x] Error scenarios handled gracefully _(covered by existing contract & integration suites)_
- [x] Mastra telemetry logs all executions _(asserted in `tool-execution.test.ts`)_
- [x] Performance degradation warnings logged for slow executions _(simulated in integration test)_
- [ ] Retry logic tested (simulate transient errors) _(not exercised in this run)_
- [ ] Document pagination works for >50 K char documents _(blocked: no large markdown fixtures)_
- [ ] All cross-references in `data-model.md` valid _(manual audit deferred)_

## Detailed Test Scenarios

All five quickstart scenarios remain blocked for the reasons outlined below. Where
possible we note the automated coverage that exercises related code paths.

### Scenario 1: Semantic Search (`semantic-search`)

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Requires seeded embeddings in `task_embeddings`. The workspace does not include
  that dataset, so the quickstart script cannot produce meaningful results.
- **Validation Notes**: `tool-execution.test.ts` verifies the tool can execute, log telemetry,
  and emit performance warnings.

### Scenario 2: Document Context Retrieval (`get-document-context`)

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Depends on uploaded documents and processed markdown content. The Supabase tables
  are empty in this environment.
- **Validation Notes**: Existing unit/integration tests cover pagination metadata and telemetry.

### Scenario 3: Dependency Detection (`detect-dependencies`)

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Requires AI API access plus seeded task text and embeddings. Those resources are
  unavailable in the sandbox.
- **Validation Notes**: Contract suite verifies input/output schema; integration tests cover
  error cases.

### Scenario 4: Task Graph Query (`query-task-graph`)

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Requires relationships written by T004/T008 and migration 010 data to exist. The
  Supabase instance is empty.
- **Validation Notes**: Contract tests validate schema and filtering logic.

### Scenario 5: Similarity Clustering (`cluster-by-similarity`)

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Needs at least 10 embeddings to compute clusters and centroids. Data not present.
- **Validation Notes**: Contract tests check centroid dimensionality and similarity stats.

## Performance Validation

- **Status**: BLOCKED  
- **Reason**: Load test (100 iterations per tool) cannot run without real embeddings and
  long-running environment. No latency data collected in this pass.

## Error Scenario Tests

- **Status**: PARTIAL PASS  
- **Coverage**:
  - Invalid threshold → validated in `mastra-tools.test.ts`
  - Missing required fields → validated via Zod schema tests
  - Task not found → validated in integration error suites

## Telemetry Verification

- **Status**: PASS  
- **Evidence**: `vitest run -- tool-execution.test.ts` asserts that telemetry records include
  `tool_name`, `input_params`, `output_data`, `duration_ms`, `status`, and that
  `performance_warning` flips to `true` for simulated >5 s executions.

## Next Steps / Follow-Up Actions

1. Seed Supabase with the fixture data described in `quickstart.md` (20 documents, embeddings,
   and task relationships).
2. Re-run all five quickstart scenarios manually, updating the scenario sections above with
   observed outputs, latency metrics, and validation notes.
3. Execute the load/performance validation and record P50/P95 latency per tool.
4. Re-check migration 010 state and document pagination behaviour against >50 K character
   documents.
5. Capture final checklist results and flip overall status to **PASS** once the above steps are
   complete.
