## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23
- Q: Auto-expand trace on "first visit" should trigger based on what scope? ‚Üí A: Once per browser session (resets on tab close)
- Q: Should filter selections (tool type, status) persist across page reloads? ‚Üí A: Reset on page reload (session state only)
- Q: When trace export fails (network, browser blocks, quota exceeded), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Fallback to clipboard copy if download fails
- Q: Should tool filter dropdown be dynamically populated or show all possible tools? ‚Üí A: Show all tools, but disable ones not present in trace
- Q: Should trace panel interactions support custom keyboard navigation? ‚Üí A: Follow browser defaults (no custom keyboard handling)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user who has triggered task prioritization via the agent, I want to understand how the agent made its decisions so that I can:
- Trust the prioritization results
- Debug when prioritization fails or produces unexpected results
- Learn which tools were used and what information informed the decisions
- Quickly identify and fix errors in agent execution

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have triggered agent prioritization from the priorities page, **When** the agent completes execution, **Then** I can view a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process with tool usage and outcomes

2. **Given** the reasoning trace contains multiple steps (10+), **When** I want to focus on specific tool types, **Then** I can filter the trace by tool name to see only relevant steps

3. **Given** some reasoning steps have failed during execution, **When** I view the trace, **Then** failed steps are visually highlighted with error messages, and I can quickly jump to the first failure

4. **Given** I am viewing a reasoning trace, **When** I want to collapse or expand the full trace panel, **Then** my preference is saved and persists across page reloads

5. **Given** I need to share or save the reasoning trace for debugging, **When** I click the export button, **Then** the complete trace downloads as a JSON file with all step details

6. **Given** I am in a new browser session (or first load after tab close), **When** I load the priorities page after agent execution, **Then** the trace is automatically expanded to encourage discovery

7. **Given** the trace contains both successful and failed steps, **When** I enable "show only failed steps" filter, **Then** only steps with errors are displayed while maintaining step numbering context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent execution has zero reasoning steps? (Should show "No reasoning trace available" message)
- How does the system handle traces with 50+ steps? (Filtering and virtualization may be needed in future phases)
- What if localStorage is disabled or unavailable? (Collapse/expand preference defaults to collapsed state)
- How are partially completed traces displayed? (Show all completed steps with appropriate status badges)
- What if the trace contains sensitive information? (Export should include warning about data sharing)
- What if export download fails? (Automatically fallback to clipboard copy with notification)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Discoverability:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a "View Reasoning" button in the task list header after agent execution completes
- **FR-002**: Button MUST show the total count of reasoning steps (e.g., "View Reasoning (12 steps)")
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically expand the reasoning trace panel once per browser session (resets on tab close) to encourage discovery
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the user's collapse/expand preference across page reloads using browser storage

**Filtering:**
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to filter reasoning steps by tool type using a dropdown selector that displays all available Mastra tools
- **FR-006**: Tool filter dropdown MUST disable (gray out) tools that are not present in the current trace while keeping them visible
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to filter reasoning steps by status (Success, Failed, Skipped) using checkbox controls
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to toggle "Show only failed steps" to focus on debugging errors
- **FR-009**: Filtering MUST apply instantly without page reload or API calls
- **FR-010**: Filtered views MUST maintain original step numbering for context
- **FR-011**: Filter selections MUST reset to default (all filters off) on page reload, maintaining session-only state

**Error Highlighting:**
- **FR-012**: Failed reasoning steps MUST be visually distinguished with red border and background color
- **FR-013**: System MUST display an error summary banner at the top of the trace panel when failures exist
- **FR-014**: Error summary MUST list which tools/steps failed with a count (e.g., "2 steps failed: detect-dependencies, semantic-search")
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to click the error banner to jump to the first failed step in the trace
- **FR-016**: Failed steps MUST display inline error messages explaining what went wrong

**Export:**
- **FR-017**: Users MUST be able to export the complete reasoning trace as a JSON file
- **FR-018**: Export MUST include all step details, tool inputs/outputs, status, and timing information
- **FR-019**: Exported filename MUST follow the pattern `reasoning-trace-{sessionId}-{date}.json` for easy identification
- **FR-020**: Export MUST complete within 500ms for typical traces (10-20 steps)
- **FR-021**: If file download fails (network issues, browser blocks, quota exceeded), system MUST automatically fallback to copying trace JSON to clipboard with user notification

**Performance:**
- **FR-022**: Filtering operations MUST apply in less than 100ms
- **FR-023**: Expanding/collapsing trace sections MUST not cause UI lag or jank
- **FR-024**: Trace panel MUST support traces with up to 50 reasoning steps without performance degradation

### Key Entities

- **ReasoningTrace**: Represents the complete execution history for an agent session, containing multiple reasoning steps, overall status, and timing metadata
- **ReasoningStep**: Individual step in the trace with tool name, status (success/failed/skipped), inputs, outputs, error messages, and duration
- **AgentSession**: Links a reasoning trace to a specific agent execution, outcome, and user context
- **ToolUsageSummary**: Aggregates which tools were used and how many times across the trace

## Dependencies & Assumptions

**Dependencies:**
- Reasoning trace infrastructure already exists (`ReasoningTracePanel.tsx`)
- API endpoints for fetching traces are operational (`/api/agent/sessions/*`)
- Database schema includes `reasoning_traces` and `agent_sessions` tables
- Mastra telemetry is storing all agent execution steps

**Assumptions:**
- Users have already triggered at least one agent prioritization
- Browser supports localStorage for preference persistence
- Traces with 0-50 steps are the expected range (not thousands)
- JSON export is sufficient (no CSV/PDF formats needed)
- Keyboard accessibility relies on native browser behavior (no custom keyboard shortcuts or navigation patterns)

**Out of Scope (Future Phases):**
- Dependency graph visualization (Phase 6+)
- Trace comparison/diff view between multiple sessions
- Real-time streaming of reasoning steps during execution
- Historical trace browser showing all past executions
- Inline editing or annotations on reasoning steps
- Advanced search/regex filtering within trace content
- Performance profiling charts (token usage, latency breakdown)

---

## Success Metrics

**Discoverability:**
- 60%+ of users expand reasoning trace at least once within their first 3 agent runs
- Average time to discover trace: <1 minute from page load

**Utility:**
- Failed step errors surfaced within 5 seconds of viewing trace
- Users can identify problematic tools without reading full trace
- Error messages provide actionable recovery guidance

**Performance:**
- Filtering applies in <100ms (client-side only)
- Export completes in <500ms for typical traces
- No UI lag when expanding/collapsing steps

**User Satisfaction:**
- Manual review: 80%+ of error messages are actionable
- Survey feedback: "I understand why prioritization failed" ‚â•4.0/5.0
