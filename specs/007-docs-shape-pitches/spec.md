## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19
- Q: How should users initiate task prioritization? ‚Üí A: Separate "Task Priorities" page with manual refresh (dedicated workspace)
- Q: Should users see the agent's reasoning process? ‚Üí A: Show simple progress indicator during analysis, reveal reasoning in expandable panel after completion
- Q: What happens when user tries to prioritize without an active outcome? ‚Üí A: Disable prioritization feature entirely, show prompt to create outcome first
- Q: Should users access past prioritization sessions? ‚Üí A: No history, always show most recent result only
- Q: How long should reasoning traces be stored? ‚Üí A: 7 days (shorter for debugging only, minimal storage)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker with an active outcome statement and uploaded documents containing tasks, I want the system to automatically analyze my tasks and generate a prioritized execution plan that considers task dependencies, semantic relationships, and my current capacity, so I can focus on high-value work in the right order without manually organizing everything myself.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have an active outcome statement ("Increase monthly recurring revenue by 25%") and 3 documents with 50 total tasks uploaded, **When** I navigate to the Task Priorities page and click "Refresh" or trigger analysis, **Then** the system displays a prioritized list of tasks grouped into execution waves (parallel vs sequential) with dependency relationships shown.

2. **Given** the agent is analyzing my tasks, **When** the reasoning process is running, **Then** I see a progress indicator showing the analysis is in progress, and when complete, I can expand a "View Reasoning" panel to see the step-by-step trace of how the agent made its decisions.

3. **Given** the agent completes prioritization, **When** I view the results, **Then** I can see which tasks must be done first (prerequisites), which tasks are blocked by others, and which tasks can be done in parallel, along with a confidence score for the prioritization.

4. **Given** the agent attempted prioritization but one of the underlying tools (semantic search, dependency detection) failed, **When** I view the results, **Then** the system shows me a partial result with a warning about which analysis steps couldn't complete, and the prioritization is based on available data only.

5. **Given** I have no active outcome statement, **When** I navigate to the Task Priorities page, **Then** the prioritization controls are disabled and I see a prominent message prompting me to create an outcome statement first, with a link/button to the outcome creation flow.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no tasks in any uploaded documents? (Should agent return empty result gracefully or show guidance message?)
- What happens when reasoning loop exceeds 10 steps without reaching a conclusion? (Should system return partial result or error?)
- How does system handle circular dependencies detected between tasks? (Should agent flag them, break cycles intelligently, or fail with explanation?)
- What happens when user has 500+ tasks across many documents? (Performance target still <30s or different behavior for scale?)
- What happens to prioritization results when user uploads new documents or changes their outcome? (Results remain stale until user manually re-triggers analysis, which replaces previous session)
- What happens when agent session fails mid-execution? (Retry automatically, show error, or save partial progress for manual retry?)
- What happens when user triggers new prioritization while one is already running? (Should system queue the request, cancel the running session, or block the new request?)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Agent Execution
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute an autonomous reasoning loop that analyzes user tasks and generates prioritized execution plans without manual intervention once triggered.
- **FR-002**: System MUST limit reasoning loop to maximum 10 steps to prevent infinite loops and ensure timely results.
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically select appropriate tools (semantic search, dependency detection, clustering, document context, relationship queries) based on the analysis needs without user configuration.
- **FR-004**: System MUST complete the entire reasoning loop and prioritization within 30 seconds for typical workloads (up to 200 tasks across multiple documents).
- **FR-005**: System MUST consider user's active outcome statement, state preference, daily capacity, and recent reflections when generating prioritized plans.

#### Tool Orchestration
- **FR-006**: System MUST query semantic relationships between tasks to identify thematically related work that should be grouped.
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect prerequisite dependencies (Task A blocks Task B) and incorporate them into execution sequencing.
- **FR-008**: System MUST cluster similar tasks to enable batch execution recommendations.
- **FR-009**: System MUST retrieve full document context when needed to understand task relationships beyond extracted task text.
- **FR-010**: System MUST query existing stored relationships from previous analysis sessions to avoid re-analyzing known dependencies.

#### Result Generation
- **FR-011**: System MUST output prioritized task list with clear execution order (wave 1, wave 2, etc.).
- **FR-012**: System MUST identify which tasks can be executed in parallel vs which must be sequential.
- **FR-013**: System MUST include dependency graph showing prerequisite/blocking/related relationships between tasks.
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide confidence score for each prioritization decision to indicate reliability.
- **FR-015**: System MUST parse agent's natural language response into structured data (task IDs, execution waves, dependency edges).

#### Observability & Tracing
- **FR-016**: System MUST log every reasoning step including: thought process, tool selected, tool input, tool output, and step duration.
- **FR-017**: System MUST assign unique session ID to each agent execution for tracking and debugging.
- **FR-018**: System MUST make full reasoning trace retrievable after execution completes.
- **FR-019**: System MUST log telemetry data including: total steps taken, tools used, execution time, and outcome status (completed/partial/failed).
- **FR-020**: System MUST preserve reasoning trace for 7 days from session creation, then automatically delete (debugging-focused retention, minimal storage).

#### Error Handling & Graceful Degradation
- **FR-021**: System MUST continue reasoning with available tools if one tool fails, rather than aborting entire session.
- **FR-022**: System MUST return partial prioritization results when some analysis steps fail, with clear indication of what's missing.
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide actionable error messages when reasoning loop cannot complete (e.g., "No tasks found in documents" vs generic "Agent failed").
- **FR-024**: System MUST retry failed tool executions automatically (following existing Mastra retry policy) before degrading gracefully.

#### User Interface & Navigation
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide a dedicated "Task Priorities" page accessible from main navigation.
- **FR-026**: Task Priorities page MUST include a manual refresh/analyze control for users to trigger prioritization.
- **FR-027**: System MUST display prioritization results on the Task Priorities page (not on dashboard or as modal overlay).
- **FR-028**: System MUST show a progress indicator while agent reasoning is in progress (no real-time streaming of reasoning steps).
- **FR-029**: System MUST provide an expandable "View Reasoning" panel after prioritization completes, displaying the step-by-step reasoning trace.
- **FR-030**: Reasoning panel MUST show for each step: thought process, tool called (if any), tool input, tool output, and step duration.
- **FR-031**: System MUST disable all prioritization controls on Task Priorities page when no active outcome statement exists.
- **FR-032**: When no active outcome exists, system MUST display a prominent message prompting user to create an outcome statement first.
- **FR-033**: Outcome creation prompt MUST include a link or button that navigates user to the outcome creation flow.

#### Session Management
- **FR-034**: System MUST persist most recent reasoning session state automatically without user intervention.
- **FR-035**: System MUST track conversation history within a session to enable multi-turn reasoning if needed.
- **FR-036**: System MUST display only the most recent prioritization result (no historical session access required).
- **FR-037**: System MUST overwrite previous session data when new prioritization is triggered (no accumulation of historical sessions).

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Agent reasoning loop MUST achieve goal in ‚â§10 steps for 90% of sessions.
- **NFR-002**: Total execution time MUST be <30 seconds for workloads up to 200 tasks.
- **NFR-003**: Tool selection accuracy MUST be >80% (agent picks relevant tools without unnecessary calls).

#### Observability
- **NFR-004**: All agent decisions MUST be logged to telemetry system for post-execution analysis.
- **NFR-005**: Reasoning trace MUST be logically coherent when manually reviewed by developers.

### Key Entities

- **Agent Session**: Represents a single execution of the task prioritization agent, including session ID, start/end timestamps, status (running/completed/failed), and associated user context (outcome, reflections, available tasks).

- **Reasoning Trace**: Complete log of agent's decision-making process, including ordered sequence of reasoning steps, tool calls made, inputs/outputs for each tool, thought process annotations, and performance metadata (step duration, total time).

- **Reasoning Step**: Individual action within reasoning loop, containing step number, timestamp, thought/rationale, tool name (if tool was called), tool input parameters, tool output/result, duration, and status (success/failed/skipped).

- **Prioritized Task Plan**: Final output of agent session, including ordered list of task IDs, execution wave assignments (which tasks are in wave 1, 2, 3, etc.), parallel vs sequential execution flags, dependency relationships (prerequisite/blocking/related), confidence scores per task, and synthesis summary text.

- **Task Dependency**: Relationship between two tasks extracted during reasoning, including source task ID, target task ID, relationship type (prerequisite/blocks/related), confidence score, and detection method (AI inference vs stored relationship).

- **Execution Wave**: Group of tasks that can be executed together, including wave number (execution order), task IDs in the wave, parallel execution flag (can all tasks in wave run simultaneously?), and estimated duration/effort.

- **Execution Metadata**: Performance and diagnostic data for agent session, including total steps taken, tool call count by tool type, execution time breakdown (thinking time vs tool execution time), error count, and success rate metrics.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Phase 2 Tool Registry** (Spec 006): All 5 tools (semantic-search, get-document-context, detect-dependencies, query-task-graph, cluster-by-similarity) must be implemented and functional.
- **Outcome Management** (T008-T011): Active outcome statement required as input for agent context.
- **Reflections System** (T020+): Recent reflections used to inform prioritization decisions.
- **Vector Embeddings** (T020-T027): Semantic search functionality depends on task embeddings being generated.

### Assumptions
- Agent operates on tasks already extracted from documents (not extracting new tasks from raw documents).
- Agent execution is synchronous from user perspective (trigger ‚Üí wait ‚Üí see results), not background job.
- Agent has read-only access to tasks/documents (doesn't modify or create tasks during reasoning).
- Single user context (no multi-user prioritization or collaboration in this phase).
- Reasoning session data stored in database (not ephemeral/in-memory only).
